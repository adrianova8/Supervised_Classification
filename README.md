# S11 T01: Supervised Classification

**Target:*
* Classification trees
* KNN - k-Nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Vector Machine Support
* XGboost

_Let's practice and become familiar with classification algorithms_

# LEVEL 1

 ## Exercise 1
  - Create at least three different classification models to try to best predict DelayedFlights.csv flight delay (ArrDelay). Consider whether the flight is late or not (ArrDelay> 0).
 
 ## Exercise 2
  - Compare classification models using accuracy, a confidence matrix, and other more advanced metrics.

 ## Exercise 3
 - Train them using the different parameters they support.

 ## Exercise 4
 - Compare your performance using the traint / test or cross-validation approach.

 # LEVEL 2
 
 ## Exercise 5
 - Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction
  
# LEVEL 3

## Exercise 6
 - Do not use the Display variable when making predictions
